# Baseball Card Collecting and Trading Forum
#### Created by Justin Smith and Carlos Godoy

This project was built using a PostgreSQL database running on a Rails backend and React.js front end to utilize full CRUD functionality across two models. Each person displays information about the person and their own collection using a one-to-many relationship that connects the person model to the card model.
