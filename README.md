## Technologies used
ReactJS front end application that uses a Ruby on rails backend with a postgreSQL database
## Approach taken
We create our rails backend first and created our one to many relationship in our database.  Then we compartmentalized the page into components based on what table was being viewed.  The person and card views each have full CRUD functionality.  
## Problems faced
There was difficulty figuring out how to get multiple models to work correctly on the page, but it was a good learning experience.  There was also some difficulty coordinating our efforts through github which led to some confusion and lost time, but ultimately taught us a lot and made us better coders.
## Wins
We got all of our routes to work correctly and the page functions as expected.
## Future Additions
User login, hide and show forms maybe with some sort of animation, have list of person names instead of index number in create card form.
